#Easy To Use Pokemon Go Map for Windows Users#

I just made a nice python wrapper for [the proof of concept script](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map) and made a batch script to take care of the setup stuff.

##Usage##
1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) (NOT Python 3.x).
2. Download or clone this project.
3. Run "Live Pokemon Go Map.bat"
4. Follow the prompts.
5. Close the terminal when you are done.

This script will try to use, in order: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer
